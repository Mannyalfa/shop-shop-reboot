## Description

This MERN-stack application searches for books by title, author or subject using the Google books API.  After signing up, users can sign up search for books listings and save them for later retrieval once.

User Story:

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state

WHEN I review the appâ€™s store

THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store

THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider

WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state

THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store

THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions

THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
